# In the future we should change this to 0 or remove entirely. It has two
# properties that are undesirable:
#  1. If new fields are added to a model that cause it to cross this threshold,
#     we now have a breaking change.
#  2. Field order matters if we don't use object params, which means maintance
#     and code generation changes are harder to do without introducing breaking
#     changes.
